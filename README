This project attempts to create a melodious line out of a
 universal number. This number may be PI( 3.1415....),
 PHI( 1.61805...) or who know what other number may pop out.

The number itself cannot be played, so we need to interpret
 it. This is where we come in the story. We will try to make
 out a formula, group the figures, and combine with different
 sounds from the music world to output a nice wave stream.

Second time trying to push.
